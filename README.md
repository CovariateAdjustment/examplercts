The goal of `examplercts` is to facilitate teaching by providing
annotated, labelled, and documented datasets from randomized controlled
trials. These datasets have been sourced from existing R packages. This
repo is meant to provide both analysis-ready data and the code used to
produce that data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of examplercts from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("CovariateAdjustment/example_rcts")
```

Alternatively, the `devtools` package also allows installation of
packages from Github.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "CovariateAdjustment/example_rcts")
```
